# Find-the-two-non-repeating-elements-in-an-array-of-repeating-elements
C learning


The objective is to fing the two non repeating elements in an array of repeating elements.
It is guatenteed that two only two non repeating elements will be there in the arry
Eg: Input: {1,1,2,2,3,3,4,5,5,6,7,7}, Output: 4,6
The elements of the array may or not be sorted.
The logic for the implimentation using the XOR can be be found here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22952651/explain-using-xor-to-find-two-non-duplicate-integers-in-an-array
My program which can be found in the file program.c tries to implement this logic and when run it produces an error "segmentation fault(core dumped)
Please find the error and explain in the fix.
